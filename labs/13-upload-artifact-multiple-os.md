# Upload an Artifact (Multiple OS)

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a GitHub Actions workflow to upload an artifact using the `actions/upload-artifact` action for multiple operating systems. We will create a matrix strategy to run the workflow on different operating systems.

The workflow can be triggered manually or on a push event on a specified path. The uploaded artifact can be downloaded from the Actions tab on the GitHub repository. We will then test the uploaded artifact on different operating systems.
