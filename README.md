# GitHub Actions Workshop

This repository contains the code for the GitHub Actions Workshop. The workshop is designed to help you get started with GitHub Actions and learn how to use them to automate your software development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before you start the workshop, make sure you have the following:

- A laptop or desktop computer with either Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system. You will need internet access to complete the workshop.
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](http://github.com).
- A code editor. You can use any code editor of your choice. If you don't have one, you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- A basic understanding of Git and GitHub. If you're new to Git and GitHub, you can follow the [Getting Started with GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

## Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Understand the basics of GitHub Actions.
- Understand the YAML syntax used to define workflows.
- Understand workflow syntax and how to write workflows using intellisense.
- Set up a GitHub Actions workflow.
- Trigger a workflow using events.
- Learn the context and expression syntax as well as workflow commands.
- Understand different hosting options for runners.
- Build a workflow using actions.
- Customize a workflow using job and step attributes.
- Use secrets and environment variables in workflows.
- Workflow templates and reusable workflows.
- Integrate GitHub Actions with other tools and services.
- Follow best practices for using GitHub Actions.
